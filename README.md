Website in Html/Css/Jscript intended to run SQL queries from a database for data extraction purposes.

This website relies on making a SQL connection using only Javascript which is generally seen as dangerous or unsecure.

Use it at your own risk.

! As of now, this website uses ActiveX properties only available in IE, which means this website will only work in IE !

This was realised for my internship, and intended to be used only on a local network, again, this HAS security flaws.
