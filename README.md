# DashBoard
Website in Html/Css/Jscript intended to run SQL queries from a database for data extraction purposes.

This website relies on making a SQL connection using only Javascript which is generally seen as dangerous or unsecure.

This software is available AS IS, without warranty to the extent permitted by law.

! As of now, this app uses ActiveX properties only available in IE, which means this website will only work in IE !

This is an unsecured, hugely flawed idea. It is a security issue in out of itself. Consider yourself warned.
Also, terrible code ahead.
